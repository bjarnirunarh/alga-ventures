    details: `Built to streamline how fresh landings are communicated and sold, Fishlert lets boats report catch via text message in seconds. The system updates a centralized Google Sheet with species, weight, dock, and landing date — and automatically triggers SMS alerts to buyers interested in that species.\n\nBuyers can reserve by replying with a standardized format like YES, Ocean Wind, Black Cod, 100. The backend parses the message, logs the reservation, adjusts availability, and triggers confirmations — all in under 2 seconds.\n\nBuilt with Node.js, Express, Google Sheets API, and Twilio, Fishlert proves that traceability and freshness can be delivered with minimal UI — by leveraging tools users already know: SMS and spreadsheets. It's lean, fast, and designed to scale with small boats and big catches alike.`,
